Hello!

Information retrieval based search engine
(Ankita Budhraja)
 

Type of Project: Implementation

Project Overview

This project is influenced by class concepts and readings on Information retrieval, Web Crawling, Search Engines, text analysis with TF-IDF and BM25, Cosine similarity, etc.

Intrigued by the ElasticSearch engine in the assignment 'Search Ranking and Evaluation'. I developed a similar search engine using Python for News Articles and Movie Dataset. Apart from having search queries to find word similarities based on them, I also developed a recommendation system for news articles and movies. 

Following tasks can be performed by this program:
a. searching for a news article mentioning keywords. For e.g. stock prices, kolkata india, october november etc.
b. looking up for movies similar to a given movie as recommendations. For e.g. input a movie name “Jumaji” and get top 10 similar movie recommendations as output.
c. looking up for news articles similar to a given headline. For e.g. Taking one headline as input “Edtech’s failure is Indian education sector's curse to bear” and getting top 5 article recommendations based on the query. 

I also wanted to learn more about web crawling and scraping, hence, I tested the recommendation system on 2 datasets - one created by web scraping news articles from moneycontrol.com and another annotated dataset on “movies” from Kaggle.
